#Bandit level 16->17
##Objective: The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
##Steps taken
1. Connecting to the server
   Command: ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220
   logged in using password from previous level
2. listing out the localhost
   command: nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
   we get 5 potential local host
3. listing out the required localhost
  command: nmap -p 31046,31518,31691,31790,31960 -A localhost
  localhost 31790 is the required localhost
4. Connecting to localhost
   command: ncat --ssl localhost 31790
   enter the password for the current level and we get the credentials for the next level.
5. copying the credentials to local host
   command: cat "content " > private17.keys
6. changing the mode of the file private17.key
   command: chmod 700 private17.keys
7. login to bandit17
   command: ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 -i private17.key
8. retrieving the password
   command: /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
   retrived the password for next level
